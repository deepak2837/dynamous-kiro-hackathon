**Problem**: User IDs stored inconsistently (ObjectId vs mobile number) for medical students  
**Manual Approach**: Single query format (breaks frequently)  
**Kiro's Robust Solution**:
```python
# Kiro's intelligent multi-format user identification
user_queries = [
    user_id, str(user_id), ObjectId(user_id),
    {"mobile_number": user_id}, {"email": user_id},
    {"student_id": user_id}  # Medical college student ID support
]
sessions = await db.sessions.find({
    "$or": [{"user_id": {"$in": user_queries}}]
}).sort("created_at", -1)
```

### 3. Large Medical File Processing - Kiro's Performance Optimization
**Problem**: Timeout on large medical textbooks and presentation files  
**Manual Approach**: Increase timeout limits (inefficient)  
**Kiro's Solution**: Direct file upload to Gemini with medical content optimization and chunking

### 4. Mock Test Timing - Kiro's React State Mastery
**Problem**: Frontend timer state management for medical exam simulation  
**Manual Approach**: Basic useState timer (memory leaks)  
**Kiro's Solution**: useRef with proper cleanup and medical exam timing standards

Human Anatomy - Cardiovascular System

The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body. It has four chambers: two atria and two ventricles.

Key Points:
- Right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body
- Left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs  
- Right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs
- Left ventricle pumps blood to the body

The cardiac cycle consists of systole (contraction) and diastole (relaxation).

Important structures:
- Aorta: Main artery carrying blood from left ventricle
- Pulmonary artery: Carries blood from right ventricle to lungs
- Tricuspid valve: Between right atrium and ventricle
- Mitral valve: Between left atrium and ventricle

Clinical correlations:
- Heart failure occurs when the heart cannot pump effectively
- Myocardial infarction (heart attack) results from blocked coronary arteries
- Arrhythmias are abnormal heart rhythms
